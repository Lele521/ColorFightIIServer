<h1>ColorfightII Rules</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ColorfightII is a round based game. For each round, the players can send an
action list during a period of time, then the server will update based on the 
actions.</p>
<p>Each player has two kinds of resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Gold</li>
</ul>
<p>Players use energy to attack and occupy other cells to collect more gold and
energy source.</p>
<p>Players use gold to build different buildings on their own cells to help the
game process.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, the player with the highest amount of gold wins.</p>
<h2>Game Feature</h2>
<h3>MapCell</h3>
<p>A <code>MapCell</code> represents a cell that a user can occupy. </p>
<p><code>MapCell</code> can produce energy and gold for each round. It has three natural
attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>natural_energy</code> (1 - 10)</li>
<li><code>natural_gold</code> (1 - 10)</li>
<li><code>natural_cost</code> (1 - 300)</li>
</ul>
<p>The natural attributes of a cell will not change in a game. However, the actual
energy and gold it produces and the actual cost to occupy it may change due to
other aspects. </p>
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>Players can build on a <code>MapCell</code> that's owned by them.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Home</code> is automatically built on the cell that the player spawns. 
<ul>
<li><code>attack_cost</code> 1000</li>
<li><code>energy</code> 10</li>
<li><code>gold</code> 10</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>EnergyWell</code> is the building to increase the energy production.
<ul>
<li><code>cost</code> = 100 <code>gold</code></li>
<li><code>energy</code> = <code>natrual_energy * 2</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>GoldMine</code> is the building to increase the gold production.
<ul>
<li><code>cost</code> = 100 <code>gold</code></li>
<li><code>gold</code> = <code>natrual_gold * 2</code> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A building will be destroyed if the cell is attacked by other player.</p>
<h4>Force Field</h4>
<p>A <code>MapCell</code> will have a <code>force_field</code> after it's occupied by a player.
<code>force_field</code> is determined by the energy a player puts to attack the cell 
and the total energy all players put to attack this cell. </p>
<p><code>force_field = int(min(1000, 2*(energy*2 - total_energy)))</code></p>
<p><code>force_field</code> will be added to <code>attack_cost</code></p>
<h3>GameMap</h3>
<p><code>GameMap</code> consists of <code>GAME_WIDTH * GAME_HEIGHT</code> <code>MapCell</code>s.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, the game will generate a <code>GameMap</code> and blur
it so the <code>natrual_cost</code> will be smooth.</p>
<h3>User</h3>
<p>Each player enters the game with a <code>username</code> and a <code>password</code>. If a
player register with the same <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>, it will be 
treated as the same user. </p>
<p>A player starts with 100 <code>energy</code> and 0 <code>gold</code>. </p>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>In the beginning of each round, a map will be generated. Each cell of the map
will have <code>natrual_cost</code>, <code>natural_energy</code> and <code>natural_gold</code> 
attributes. </p>
<h3>Register</h3>
<p>During anytime of the game, a player is allowed to join, or register to the
game. The player will be assigned to a cell, this cell will be the home of
the player. A player will have 100 <code>energy</code> when register to the game.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<p>For each round, a player could give a list of valid commands. The possible 
commands are:</p>
<ul>
<li>attack</li>
<li>build</li>
</ul>
<h4>attack</h4>
<p>A player could use a certain amount of energy to attack a cell that's adjacent
to occupied cells. The amount of energy has to be more than or equal to the 
<code>attack_cost</code> of that cell, otherwise the command will fail. Failed command
will not cost the player's energy.</p>
<p>The more energy the player uses to attack the cell, the more <code>force_field</code>
will be generated so the cell is harder to attack by other players. </p>
<p>If multiple players attack one cell in a single round, the player has to spend
more than 50% of the total energy spent on that cell to occupy the cell. If
no player satisfied this condition, no player will occupy the cell, but all the
energy they use will be spent. </p>
<h4>build</h4>
<p>A player could build on the occupied cell.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<h4>Force field</h4>
<p>For each enemy's cell around the cell, <code>force_field</code> will lose 5% for each
round.</p>
<h4>Order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Parse all the commands
<ol>
<li>building will be built</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Update cells
<ol>
<li>parse all the attack commands, calculate the owner of the cell for next
round.</li>
<li><code>gold</code> and <code>energy</code> income will be calculated based on the new
possessions.</li>
<li><code>force_field</code> will be updated accordingly.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Update players
<ol>
<li><code>gold</code> and <code>energy</code> will be updated </li>
<li>player without any cell will be dead </li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
